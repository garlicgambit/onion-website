# Description:
# This script generates and sets a pseudo-random mac address on interface eth0.
# This script is created because the Raspberry Pi doesn't accept mac addresses
# from the macchanger package.
# It is not completely random because it won't set broadcast, multicast
# or 'locally administered' mac addresses. This is done by setting the
# second hexadecimal character in the mac address to zero.
#
# This script is used in combination with the /etc/network/interfaces file.
#
# TODO:
# - Get macchanger package to work
#

# {{ ansible_managed }}

# Bash options
